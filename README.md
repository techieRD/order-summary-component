## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

This gave me the opportunity to learn how someone would code from client's spec document,
which is something I haven't had an opprotunity to do.

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

I didn't know about this markdown guide either ... pretty cool.

### Continued development

I need to learn more about flexbox and css grids. I've used flexbox before, but need a refresher since it's been many years since I used itl

### Useful resources

I lots of courses on Udemy that I reference as I am learning.
